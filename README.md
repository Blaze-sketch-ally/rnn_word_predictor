I developed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based word predictor trained on Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict the next word in a sequence, effectively learning the style and structure of Shakespearean language.

Key components and technologies used:

Python – Core programming language for data processing and model development.

TensorFlow / Keras – For building and training the RNN model.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) – A type of RNN used to capture long-term dependencies in text sequences.

Numpy & Pandas – For handling and preprocessing textual data.

Tokenizer & Sequence Padding – From Keras, to convert text into numerical sequences suitable for model input.

Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, sequence generation, and cleaning for optimal model performance.

Prediction Pipeline – Takes a text input and predicts the next word, demonstrating generative text capability.

The model can generate sequences in the style of Hamlet, showcasing deep learning applied to creative text generation.
